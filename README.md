## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

Next, set up your environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required fields.

Finally, you can run the main application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

🎯 Key Features
